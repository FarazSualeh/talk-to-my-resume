# Talk To My Resume

**Talk To My Resume** is a privacy-focused web application that allows users to upload their resume and ask focused questions to better understand how their experience is presented.

Built as a real-world learning project, this tool helps students and freshers explore their resume content through grounded, resume-aware answers instead of generic suggestions.
